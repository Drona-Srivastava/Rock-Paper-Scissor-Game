# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
This is Rock Paper Scissor game i made to get a better understanding of using JavaScript logics.
In this game we have two players one is the user and other one is the computer which has JavaScript logic behind it. 
We compare the user input and random value chosen by the logic and give out the result.
